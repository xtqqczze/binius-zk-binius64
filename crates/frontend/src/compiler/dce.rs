//! Dead-code elimination for the gate graph.
//!
//! A gate is *live* when it can affect the constraint system:
//! - it has no output wires — an assertion, which is itself a constraint;
//! - one of its outputs is observable — a public input/output, or a wire pinned as committed;
//! - one of its outputs feeds a live gate.
//!
//! A dead gate only constrains wires that no assertion or public output transitively reads.
//! Skipping it at constraint-emission time drops those AND/MUL constraints.
//! Its output wire is then referenced by nothing.
//! An unreferenced internal wire is allocated as scratch, never committed.
//!
//! Dropping a dead constraint is a bit-exact rewrite.
//! The pinned wire is unread by any output or assertion.
//! Removing a constraint on an unread wire cannot change soundness.
