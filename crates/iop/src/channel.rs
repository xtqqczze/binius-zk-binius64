//! Channel abstraction for interactive oracle protocol (IOP) verifiers.
//!
//! An IOP extends the public-coin interactive protocol model with oracle access: the prover can
//! commit to oracles (e.g., Merkle trees) that the verifier can query at specific positions. This
//! module provides the [`IOPVerifierChannel`] trait that models the verifier's view of such an
//! interaction.
//!
//! The trait extends [`IPVerifierChannel`] with additional methods for:
//! - Receiving oracle commitments from the prover
//! - Querying oracle positions and receiving opening proofs
//!
//! This abstraction allows protocol implementations to be generic over the underlying
//! communication and commitment mechanisms.
