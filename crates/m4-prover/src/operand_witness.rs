//! The batched operand-column witnesses built from a populated batch value table.
//!
//! Every AND, IMUL, and BMUL constraint is projected to its fixed-arity operand columns (`[A, B]`
//! for AND, `[A, B, HI, LO]` for IMUL, `[A_LO, A_HI, B_LO, B_HI, C_LO, C_HI]` for BMUL), one
//! column per operand, stacked over every instance in the batch. [`build_operation_witness`] is the
//! shared arity-generic core: it projects one operand per constraint into one column.
//! [`BatchAndCheckWitness`] builds the two AND columns and drives the AND-check zerocheck.
//! The AND check's C column is never materialized: the reduction derives `C = A & B` on the fly.
//! [`build_intmul_witness`] builds the four IntMul columns; [`build_binmul_witness`] builds the six
//! BinMul columns.

/// The row index splits cleanly into the constraint and the per-constraint instance:

/// - The high bits select the constraint.
