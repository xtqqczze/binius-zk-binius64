/// ## Arguments
///
/// * `n_vars` - The number of variables in the multivariate polynomial
/// * `degree` - The degree of the univariate polynomial in each round
/// * `sum` - The claimed sum of the multivariate polynomial over the boolean hypercube
/// * `channel` - The channel for receiving prover messages and sampling challenges
///
/// ## Returns
///
/// Returns a `Result` containing the `SumcheckOutput` with the reduced evaluation and challenge
/// point, or an error if verification fails.
