//! Portable (non-CLMUL) multiplication for the Monbijou field and its degree-2 extension.
//!
//! These are software implementations of the algorithms in the [parent module](super), built on
//! the portable carry-less multiply primitives in `crate::arch::portable64` rather than on CLMUL or
//! SIMD intrinsics. They operate on scalar `u64`/`u128` values, one field element at a time.

/// as `[low, high]` 64-bit limbs, without the modular reduction.
///
/// `bmul64` gives the low limb directly. The high limb comes from multiplying the bit-reversed
/// operands and reversing the result: reversing a product of two degree-`<64` polynomials leaves it
/// shifted by one bit, which the final shift removes. Because [`reduce`] is F2-linear, these limbs
/// can be XOR-accumulated across many products and reduced only once — an inner product of `n`
