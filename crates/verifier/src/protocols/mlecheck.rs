/// An MLE-check protocol is an interactive protocol similar to sumcheck, but with modifications
/// introduced in [Gruen24], Section 3.
///
/// The prover in an MLE-check argues a that for some $n$-variate polynomial
/// $F(X_0, \ldots, X_{n-1})$ (which is not necessarily multilinear), for a given point
/// $(z_0, \ldots, z_{n-1})$ and claimed value $s$, that
///
/// $$
/// s = \sum_{v \in B_n} F(v) \cdot eq(v, z)
/// $$
///
/// Unless $F$ is indeed multilinear, $s \ne F(z)$ necessarily. While the prover and verifier could
/// engage in a standard sumcheck protocol to reduce this claim, it is concretely more efficient to
/// use the optimized protocol from [Gruen24], which we call an "MLE-check".
///
/// [Gruen24]: <https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/108>
///
/// ## Arguments
///
/// * `n_vars` - The number of variables in the multivariate polynomial
/// * `degree` - The degree of the univariate polynomial in each round
/// * `eval` - The claimed multilinear-extension evaluation of the multivariate polynomial
/// * `transcript` - The transcript containing the prover's messages and randomness for challenges
///
/// ## Returns
///
/// Returns a `Result` containing the `SumcheckOutput` with the reduced evaluation and challenge
/// point, or an error if verification fails.
