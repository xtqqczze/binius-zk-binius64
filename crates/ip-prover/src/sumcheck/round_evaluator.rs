//! Round evaluators over a shared [`MleStore`] and the provers that drive them.
//!
//! A round evaluator holds the per-round-polynomial logic for one composite claim over store
//! columns. Evaluators hold [`ColId`]s and receive column data by argument; they hold no mutable
//! per-round state — they neither fold nor track the round claim. The driving prover owns the
//! `RoundState` machine (the claim ↔ coeffs alternation) for each evaluator, and the store folds
//! the columns (see the [`mle_store`](super::mle_store) module documentation).
//!
//! There are two evaluator traits, one per protocol:
//! - [`SumcheckRoundEvaluator`], driven by [`SharedSumcheckProver`], emits regular sumcheck round
//!   polynomials.
//! - [`MleCheckRoundEvaluator`], driven by [`SharedMleCheckProver`], emits the eq-factored prime
//!   round polynomials of the MLE-check protocol. Its claims all share one evaluation point, so the
//!   prover — not the evaluator — owns that point's eq-indicator tracker and passes the round's eq
//!   chunk and coordinate to the evaluator.
//!
//! Both provers adapt a store plus a list of evaluators — one per claim — to the [`SumcheckProver`]
//! interface (and [`SharedMleCheckProver`] additionally to [`MleCheckProver`]), so they batch
//! alongside standalone provers unchanged.

/// The driving [`SharedSumcheckProver`] makes one parallel pass over column chunks per round; the
/// hot loops stay monomorphized inside each evaluator and only the per-chunk [`Self::accumulate`]
/// entry is virtual. Within a round the calls are: [`Self::accumulate`] from parallel workers into
/// per-worker accumulator slices, then [`Self::interpolate`] once on the slot-wise summed slice.
/// The driving prover, not the evaluator, holds the round claim and reduces the round polynomial
/// against the verifier challenge.
///
/// The accumulator is a flat slice of [`Self::degree`] wide (unreduced)
/// [`WideMul::Output`](WideMul::Output) slots. The driving prover owns the buffer, sizes it from
/// [`Self::degree`], and sums the workers' slices slot-wise, so evaluators implement neither
/// allocation nor merging — only the write pass and the interpolation. The slot layout within an
/// evaluator's run is private to that evaluator.
///
/// Evaluators are stateless across rounds: they hold no round claim and never fold. The prover
/// passes the round claim into [`Self::interpolate`] and recovers it back out of the emitted round
/// polynomial itself (as $R(0) + R(1)$), so the whole claim ↔ coeffs state machine lives in the
/// prover's `RoundState`.
///
/// The `auto_impl(Box)` derive forwards the trait through `Box`, so a heterogeneous group of
/// evaluators can drive a shared prover as `Vec<Box<dyn SumcheckRoundEvaluator<F, P>>>` while a
