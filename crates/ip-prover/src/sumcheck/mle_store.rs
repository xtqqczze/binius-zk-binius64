//! Shared multilinear column store for sumcheck round evaluators.
//!
//! An [`MleStore`] owns the equal-length multilinear columns that a group of
//! [round evaluators](super::round_evaluator) reads, along with the deduplicated
//! [`Gruen32`] equality-indicator trackers for MLE-check evaluation points. Columns enter the
//! store either borrowed ([`MleStore::push`]) or owned ([`MleStore::push_owned`]) and are
//! addressed by the returned [`ColId`], so several evaluators can read — and the store can fold —
//! one shared column exactly once per challenge.
//!
//! # Invariant
//!
//! The store folds — columns and eq trackers both; evaluators only read. Every column and every
//! registered tracker advances exactly once per [`MleStore::fold`] call, no matter how many
//! evaluators reference it.
//!
//! Folding is eager: [`MleStore::fold`] advances every column immediately, and the round pass
//! over the columns is a plain read. A deferred-fold variant that fuses the fold into the next
//! round's read pass can replace the internals without changing this interface.
