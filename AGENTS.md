# AGENTS.md

Quick-start context for AI agents and developers working with Binius64.

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build                    # Debug build
cargo build --release          # Release build
cargo test                     # Run tests
cargo test -p <crate>          # Test specific crate
cargo +nightly-2026-01-01 fmt  # Format code (pinned nightly; see prek.toml)
cargo clippy --all --all-features --tests --benches --examples -- -D warnings
cargo doc --no-deps --document-private-items   # Build rustdoc
typos                          # Check for typos
prek run --all-files           # Run all checks
```

For optimal performance: `export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"`

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Shifted value index** | Tuple `(value_id, shift_op, shift_amount)` - references a witness word with an optional shift |
| **AND constraint** | `A & B ^ C = 0` where A, B, C are XOR combinations of shifted values |
| **MUL constraint** | `A * B = HI \|\| LO` - unsigned 64-bit multiplication producing 128-bit result |
| **Tower field $T_i$** | Binary extension field $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2^i}}$, e.g. $T_7 = \mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}$ |
| **Sumcheck** | Protocol reducing multivariate polynomial evaluation to univariate checks |
| **BaseFold** | Polynomial commitment scheme using FRI over binary fields |
| **Witness** | The secret input values (64-bit words) that satisfy the constraint system |
| **Circuit** | High-level representation of computation built with `CircuitBuilder` |
| **Constraint system** | Low-level AND/MUL constraints compiled from a circuit |

## Coding Guidelines

**Code comments explain current behavior, not change history.** Do not write comments that reference how the code used to work ("Previously X", "Changed from A to B", "Used to call Y"). Comments must make sense in the context of the current code, independently of its history. Context about what changed and why belongs in the commit description and PR body, not in source code.

## Documentation

### Development Guidelines
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers code style, naming conventions, copyright headers, error handling, and other development conventions.

### README
The [README.md](README.md) is the project's entry point, covering what Binius64 is, dependencies, build instructions, and links to external documentation.

### Architecture
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) provides a high-level overview of the codebase: the list of crates, their purposes, and how they relate to each other.

### Protocol Specification
The canonical protocol documentation is in a separate binius.xyz repository. If the developer has cloned it as a sibling directory, you can read files directly:
- **Blueprint**: `../binius.xyz/docs/pages/blueprint/` - cryptographic protocol specification
- **Building guides**: `../binius.xyz/docs/pages/building/` - practical usage guides
- **Math background**: `../binius.xyz/docs/pages/blueprint/math/` - mathematical foundations

See `.claude/skills/binius-xyz-docs/SKILL.md` for directory structure and common query patterns.

**If `../binius.xyz` doesn't exist**, inform the user they can clone it for better agent assistance:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/binius-zk/binius.xyz.git ../binius.xyz
```
Alternatively, use the online docs at https://www.binius.xyz/blueprint.
